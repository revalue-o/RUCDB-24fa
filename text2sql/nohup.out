/home/liuyaoyang/anaconda3/envs/myenv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/transformers/generation/configuration_utils.py:590: UserWarning: `do_sample` is set to `False`. However, `temperature` is set to `0` -- this flag is only used in sample-based generation modes. You should set `do_sample=True` or unset `temperature`. This was detected when initializing the generation config instance, which means the corresponding file may hold incorrect parameterization and should be fixed.
